# README 

This directory contains the first project of my study.
Using Pandas to import json file.

The data directory and the ipython notebook is provided by SpringBoard

The two extra files:

1. style-notebook.css
2. style-table.css

is the CSS file in order to make the ipython notebook beautiful.
I get them from the youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw&t=7912s
